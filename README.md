Welcome to the IoT Smart Greenhouse System developed for my university course.

System Overview:
This system is designed to monitor and control environmental conditions within a greenhouse to optimize plant growth. It features the following components:

1. Sensors:
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - Soil Moisture
   - CO2 Levels
   - Smoke Detection

2. Control Systems:
   - Irrigation System
   - Ventilation System

3. Security:
   - RFID Reader for Access Control

4. Power:
   - Solar Panels
   - Batteries

Usage:
1. Setup:
   - Install sensors and connect them to the HomeGateway.

2. Operation:
   - The system will continuously monitor environmental conditions.
   - In case of abnormal CO2 or smoke levels, alerts will be triggered.
   - RFID access control ensures security.


Research Paper:
A step-by-step implementation guide is provided in the attached research paper, authored by me, Hania SeifElDeen,. This paper offers comprehensive insights into the development and deployment of the IoT Smart Greenhouse System. Note that the system simulation was conducted using Cisco Packet Tracer.
